* Render a game board in the browser
* Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select); your game should prevent users from playing a turn into a square that is already occupied

* Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
* Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
* Use Javascript with jQuery for DOM manipulation
* Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
